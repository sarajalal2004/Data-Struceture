# Challenges: What challenges did you encounter during the implementation?
- The stack test expression cases
# Efficiency: How efficient is your solution? Could there be a more optimal approach?
- The stack reverse is effecient, where other two could be improved.
# Applications: Consider how the stack data structure can be applied in other programming problems. Discuss any ideas or insights
- As I know it is widely used in app excution for saving the local veriables, handling the flow control and addresses.
